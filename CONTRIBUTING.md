### 7.2 Explanation
#### 7.2.1 Type (mandatory)
The **type** of a commit message should be a single word or abbreviation drawn
from an ontology, according to the nature of the project. This document
specifies a programming ontology, with the following elements:

 * **`blob:`**     A newly created file. Better when just creating an empty file
                   rather than an almost finished file. May include _#wip_
                   metatag. May be used when changing file permissions.
 * **`tree:`**     Like above, but for directories. May include _#wip_ metatag.
                   May be used when changing dir permissions.
 * **`fix:`**      A hot/bug fix.
 * **`style:`**    Changes to the text **_Styling/Formatting_** - that do not
                   affect the meaning of the code (white-spaces, comments,
                   indentation, missing punctuation, typos, etc).
 * **`refactor:`** The everyday changes to the code that are not style changes.
                   Changes to the code **_Composition/Organization_** - improving
                   readability/performance and neither fixes a bug nor adds
                   features (changes to code lines/blocks, functions, structures).
 * **`feat:`**     A new feature (a whole unit of functionalities). Use this only
                   when merging a feature branch or a whole set of files that only
                   have feature changes.
 * **`docs:`**     Documentation-only changes.
 * **`test:`**     Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones.
 * **`build:`**    Changes to the build/compilation/packaging process or auxiliary
                   tools such as documentation generation or external dependencies.
 * **`ci/cd:`**    Changes in the **_Continuous Integration/Delivery_** setup, files, scripts, etc.
 * **`notice:`**   Changes to announce/warn anything related to: files, code blocks, etc.
 * **`chore:`**    For any other repetitive and periodic tasks (like cleanups of
                   deprecated bits, or bumping versions of things). If it's something
                   a bot could have done instead of the devs, it's likely a chore.
                   May be used instead as meta hashtag for repetitive refactors,
                   i.e. always adding aliases to an .aliases file.

 * **`revert:`**   If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with
             _"revert:"_, followed by the subject of the reverted commit. In the
             body it should say: "This reverts commit `<hash>`.", where the hash
             is the SHA of the commit being reverted and explain the reason(s),
             and footer say: "Reverts `<hash>`". For example:

        revert: include more details in command-line help text:
        ---------- blank line -----------
        This reverts commit 5b233b5a
        --------- blank line -----------
        Reverts 5b233b5a


Header line may be prefixed for continuous integration purposes.

> For example, [Jira](https://bigbrassband.com/git-for-jira.html)
> requires ticket in the beginning of commit message:<br>
> `[LHJ-16] fix(compile): add unit tests for windows`


#### 7.2.2 Scope (optional)
Usually it is convenient to mention exactly which part of the code base changed.
The **scope** token is responsible for providing that information. While the
granularity of the scope can vary, it is important for it to be a part of the
"common language" spoken in the project.
Please notice that in some cases the scope is naturally too broad, and
therefore not worthy to mention. `<TYPE>` and `<SCOPE>` may be mutually exclusive.

	feat(auth): introduce sign-in via GitHub


#### 7.2.3 Subject (mandatory)
The **subject** token should contain a succinct description of the change(s).

 * Soft limit: **50** chars. Hard limit: **72** chars.
 * Use the infinitive tense to mainly describe the behavior of the program
   after the commit, i.e. _“change”_. Avoid describe your _coding behavior_.
 * May be prefixed for CI/CD purposes.
 * Do not capitalize the subject line. (Non-standard)
 * Do not end the subject line with a period.

```
refactor: move folder structure to `src` directory layout
```

#### 7.2.4 Meta (optional)
The end of subject-line may contain **hashtags** to facilitate changelog generation
and bissecting:

 * **`#wip`**: The feature being implemented is not complete yet. Should not be
 included in changelogs (just the last commit for a feature goes to the changelog).

 * **`#irrelevant`**: The commit does not add useful information. Used when fixing
 typos, etc. Should not be included in changelogs.

```
blob: add TODO markdown file #wip #irrelevant
```

#### 7.2.5 Body (mandatory)
Includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior in
order to illustrate the impact of the change.

 * Soft limit: **72** chars. Hard limit: **100** chars.
 * Use infinitive, present tense: “change”, not “changed” nor “changes”
 * Use the body to explain _What_ and _Why_, not _How_.
 * Keep it Simple, Future-proof, Junior-dev friendly.
 * Markup syntax as Markdown can be applied here.
	* For simple headers, type a space (So git couldn't parse it as comment), then use `H5` or `H6`: ` ##### <header>`
 * See [1](#commit-link-1) and [2](#commit-link-2) for more info.

Optional directives to write the body.

 * Why you made the change in the first place:
	* The way things worked before the change (and what was wrong with that),
	the way they work now, and why  you decided to solve it the way you did.
	See [3](#commit-link-3).
* You may explain the same changes in 4 different perspectives:
	* From the user’s perspective: A description of how a user would see
	incorrect program behavior, steps to reproduce a bug, user goals that
	the commit is addressing, what they can see, who is affected.
	* From a manager’s perspective: Design choices, your creativity, why
	you made the changes.
	* From the code’s perspective: A line-by-line, function-by-function, or
	file-by-file summary.
	* From git’s perspective: Any related commits in this or another repository,
	especially if you are reverting earlier changes; related GitHub issues.
	See [4](#commit-link-4).

```
feat($browser): add onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)

##### New $browser event:
 - forward popstate event if available
 - forward hashchange event if popstate not available
 - do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available

Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)
```

#### 7.2.6 Footer (optional)
 * All breaking changes or deprecations have to be mentioned in footer with the
	description of the change, justification and migration notes.

	```
	Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)
	```

 * Referencing issues: closed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the
	footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword.

	```
	Closes #123
	Closes #123, #245, #992
	```

### 7.3 Extras
#### 7.3.1 Generating `CHANGELOG.md`
Changelogs may contain three sections: **new features**, **bug fixes**, **breaking
changes**. This list could be generated by script when doing a release, along
with links to related commits. Of course you can edit this change log before
actual release, but it could generate the skeleton.

 * List of all subjects (first lines in commit message) since last release:

	```
	git log <last tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s
	```

* New features in this release:

	```
	git log <last release> HEAD --grep feat
	```
